The "control program" directory is the nerve center of the robotics repository, housing the software and control logic responsible for the robot's functionality. This section encompasses source code, formware and configuration files that orchestrate the robot's movements, responses and interactions.

1: Source Code (src):

The "src" directory within "ControlPrograms" is where contributors find the source code responsible for the robot's behavior. Organized by programing languages or platforms, such as "src/C++" or "src/Python", this section provides the programing logic that governs the robot's actions.

2: Configration Files:

The "config" directory contains configuration files essentail for fine-tuning the behavior of the control programs. These files allow contributors to customize parameters, adapt the robot to specific enviranments and optimize its performance.

3: Firmware:

For robotics systems involing embedded systems or microcontrollers, the "firmware" directory hosts the firmware files. These files ensure seamless communication between the hardware components and the control programs, forming a crucial bridge between the physical and digital realms of the robotics projects.

The "Schematics" directory serves as the repository's cornerstone for hardware-related files, housing a wealth of information crucial for understanding the construction and architecture of the robotics systems. Within this directory, contributors can find comprehensive CAD drawings, circuit diagrams and schematics, providing a detailed roadmap for the physical aspects of the robotics project.

1: CAD Drawings:

The CAD drawings within this directory include 2D and 3D representatios of the robotic systems.These files offer an intricate look at the design, layout and spatial considerations of the hardware components. CAD drawings play a pivotal role in visualzing the phyical structure,aiding both engineers and enthusiasts in understanding the assembly of the robot.

2: Circuit Daigrams:

For a deep dive into the electronic components, the "Schematics" directory includes circuit diagrams illustrating the connectivity and interactions between various electrical elecments. These daigrams are invaluable for troubleshooting, modifications and ensuring proper intergration of sensors, actuators and control systems.

3: Hardware Schematics:

Detailed schematics provide a bird's-eye view of the entire hardware architecture. They depict the arrangement of components, connections and interfaces acting as a blueprint for constructing and assembling the phyical robot. These schematics guide not only builders but also serve as a reference point for collaborators contributing to the control programs.
